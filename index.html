        <p>Going Nuclear is a multi part series where I go into detail on how nuclear weapons work, looking deep at the science and explaining how some curious discoveries in the early 20th century lead to the most powerful weapons ever used in war, and
          how those were tuned and evolved into the smaller, more powerful modern weapons.

        <p>Part 1 covers the early experimental discoveries and how they provided the theoretical underpinnings to show that Atomic chain reactions would work and how that might lead to a new form of energy.

      <p>With the basic theory having shown that a nuclear chain reaction was possible the next step is to actually make it work, first with a stable nuclear reactor - the Chicago Pile 1. Then we discuss how to go from a controllable reactor to the very
        first nuclear device - the Little Boy.

      <p>After WWII work continued on improving the technology behind the Gadget, and through a series of innovations the massive design was improved upon. Some were made more powerful, others were made smaller and eventually the first steps towards harnessing
        fusion were taken.

      <p>While the Manhatten project was working on the first fission bombs Edward Teller began working on a fusion powered 'Super' device. Fission devices were 1000 times as powerful as conventional explosives, and fusion devices could be 1000 times more
        powerful than the early fission devices.
